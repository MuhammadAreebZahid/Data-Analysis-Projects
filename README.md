Task 1: EDA and Visualization of a Real-World Dataset Dataset: I used Titanic dataset from kaggle Description: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) including data cleaning, visualization, and insights extraction.

Steps:

Loaded dataset using Pandas Cleaned data: handled missing values, removed duplicates, treated outliers Created visualizations: Bar charts for categorical variables Histograms for numerical variables Correlation heatmap Documented key insights and patterns

Task 2: Text Sentiment Analysis Dataset: I used IMDB Movie Reviews dataset from kaggle Description: Built a sentiment classification model to identify positive or negative reviews.

Steps:

Preprocessed text (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization) Converted text to numerical format using TF-IDF Trained classifiers: Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes Evaluated performance using precision, recall, and F1-score

Task 3: Fraud Detection System Dataset: I used Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from kaggle Description: Developed a binary classification model to detect fraudulent transactions.

Steps:

Handled class imbalance using SMOTE / undersampling Trained models: Random Forest / Gradient Boosting Evaluated model with precision, recall, and F1-score Built a simple CLI (command-line interface) to test inputs

Task 4: House Price Prediction (Boston Housing Dataset) Dataset: I used Boston Housing dataset from kaggle Description: Built and compared multiple regression models from scratch.

Steps:

Data and preprocessed features Implemented models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost (from scratch) Compared using RMSE and RÂ² metrics Visualized feature importance for tree-based models

Observations & Highlights 1)Learned how to clean, analyze, and visualize real-world data. 2)Built models from scratch to improve ML understanding. 3)Evaluated and improved model performance using real metrics. 4)Gained experience in text and fraud analysis.
